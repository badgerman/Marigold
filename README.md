Early 2012, I was playing around with Daisymoon, and I like the library quite a bit for 
being simple, and want to use it for prototyping, but the format for sprites is undocumented,
the tool to edit them with is nigh-incomprehensible, and I fell into the old trap of wanting
to do everything myself, so this happened.

One goal I kind of have is to eventually port this to more platforms, so I used SDL for graphics.
Another goal is to implement as much of the actual library as possible in Lua, to make it 
easier to look inside and see how things work. Lastly, I want to be as close to compatible with
Daisymoon as I can, so the tutorials and games written for it will still be working.

Enno.
